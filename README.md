# tinderMovieSwipe
Spaghetti code react-native app, first use of the framework

Shows static list of movies from dummy api.

User can swipe left to dislike or right to like a movie.

Liked movies shown in seperate views.

Had trouble passing props to tabNavigator views; this prevented sharing state between tabs.

Gonna check out redux next :)
